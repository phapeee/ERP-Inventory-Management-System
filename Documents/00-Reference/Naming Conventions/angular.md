# Angular Naming & Structure Guidelines

This document outlines the naming and structure conventions for the Angular front-end application.

## TODO

- [ ] **Modules:** Define naming conventions for feature modules and shared modules.
- [ ] **Components:** Define naming conventions for components, including selectors and file names (e.g., `*.component.ts`, `*.component.html`).
- [ ] **Services:** Define naming conventions for injectable services (e.g., `*.service.ts`).
- [ ] **Pipes:** Define naming conventions for custom pipes (e.g., `*.pipe.ts`).
- [ ] **Directives:** Define naming conventions for attribute and structural directives (e.g., `*.directive.ts`).
- [ ] **File Naming:** Establish a consistent file naming strategy (e.g., `feature.type.ts`).
- [ ] **State Management:** Define conventions for NgRx or other state management stores, actions, reducers, and effects.
