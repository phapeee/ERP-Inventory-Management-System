CI/CD Pipeline & Release/Rollback Plan
======================================

Purpose and Scope
-----------------

This document defines the continuous integration (CI) and continuous
delivery/deployment (CD) pipeline for the PineCone Pro ERP/IMS project,
along with release management and rollback strategies. It translates the
architectural principles (modular monolith on Azure App Service, Angular front‑end,
ASP.NET Core back‑end, and Docker) into a repeatable delivery
workflow that emphasises security, quality and traceability. The plan
covers all environments—development, QA/staging, UAT and production—and
describes how code flows from a commit into a running application. It also
outlines procedures for controlled releases and rapid rollbacks when
something goes wrong.

The recommendations are drawn from industry best practices for CI/CD pipelines and environment management. The pipeline is designed for a single application, but with a modular codebase that allows for future evolution. Environments must be isolated, reproducible and documented,
with QA environments mirroring production and production prioritising
high availability and disaster recovery. Separating dev, UAT and prod
environments improves stability, quality and security.

CI/CD Pipeline Overview
-----------------------

The pipeline follows a single-application design. The entire application is built, tested, and deployed as a single unit. Pipelines are defined as code (YAML) and stored in Git (GitOps) so all
changes are traceable. The high‑level stages are:

1.  **Source Control & Branching.** Developers commit code to a Git
    repository using a trunk‑based workflow with feature branches. Pull
    requests trigger pipeline runs and enforce code reviews.
2.  **Continuous Integration.** The pipeline fetches dependencies, compiles
    code and executes unit tests and static analysis. Development
    environments are isolated and reproducible using Docker or
    containers and version‑controlled configuration. Failure in any CI
    step blocks the pipeline.
3.  **Container Build & Packaging.** The application is packaged as a Docker
    image using a multi‑stage build. The image is tagged using [Semantic
    Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) and includes the Git commit
    SHA.
4.  **Security Scanning.** The container image undergoes vulnerability
    scanning and licence checks at build time. Detecting known CVEs
    early and shifting security left protects production. Secrets are
    never hard‑coded; instead, Azure Key Vault manages credentials.
5.  **Artifact Registry.** The successfully built image is pushed to Azure
    Container Registry (ACR). ACR maintains an immutable history for
    rollbacks and supports automated image signing.
6.  **Deployment to Non‑Production.** The pipeline deploys the application to development and QA environments on Azure App Service. QA environments mirror production to validate changes under
    realistic conditions. Integration tests, API tests and performance
    tests run automatically. Only tested images are promoted.
7.  **Promotion & Approvals.** A standardized template promotes the application
    across Dev → QA → Prod. Manual approvals enforce governance for
    production releases. Role‑based access control ensures only
    authorized personnel can approve deployments.
8.  **Deployment to Production.** Production deployments use progressive
    delivery strategies. Blue‑green deployments are achieved using App Service deployment slots.
    Deployment manifests include liveness/readiness probes,
    resource limits and autoscaler settings.
9.  **Observability & Feedback.** The pipeline emits logs, metrics and
    traces for each build, test and deployment. Centralised dashboards
    monitor build durations, failure patterns, promotion delays and
    environment‑specific behaviour. Alerts trigger on build failures,
    deployment rollbacks or breached SLAs. DORA metrics—lead time,
    deployment frequency, change failure rate and mean time to recovery
    (MTTR)—are tracked to gauge pipeline health.

### Environment Considerations

| Environment | Purpose | Data & Configuration | Deployment Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Development | Individual developers test code. | Synthetic or anonymised data; configuration managed in version control. Containers ensure reproducibility. | All pipeline stages run, but deployments occur to a development App Service. Feature flags can be enabled for experimentation. |
| QA / Staging | Integration, performance and user acceptance testing. Mirrors production infrastructure and policies. | Sanitised production data or seeded datasets. Environment variables mirror prod. | Deploy to a staging slot on App Service. Automated test suites run; releases are validated. |
| UAT | Business stakeholders validate features. Usually shares staging App Service but with separate slot and data sanitisation policies. | Sanitised production data; feature flags toggled to mimic production behaviour. | Deploy final release candidate; manual smoke tests. |
| Production | Live environment serving end users. Requires high availability, scalability, security and disaster recovery. | Live data; strict configuration management and secrets handling. | Progressive deployment strategies (blue‑green) with manual approval gates. Rollback plans are in place to minimise downtime. |

Pipeline Stage Specifications
-----------------------------

### Source Control & Branching

-   All code for the monolith resides in a single Git repository.
-   Developers create feature branches from `main` and submit pull
    requests (PRs). PRs require code review and must pass CI checks
    before merging.
-   Branch naming conventions (e.g. `feature/<ticket>`,
    `bugfix/<ticket>`) facilitate traceability.

### Continuous Integration

-   The CI stage runs on commit and includes unit tests, static code
    analysis (linting, style checks) and dependency vulnerability scans.
    Failing tests break the build.
-   The build pipeline runs inside a container that replicates the target
    runtime environment. Isolation and reproducibility reduce “works on
    my machine” issues.
-   Test results and code coverage are published to dashboards. Flaky
    tests are flagged and require fixing.

### Build & Packaging

-   The application is built as a single Docker image using a multi‑stage build to
    minimize image size. The image includes all runtime dependencies and
    is tagged with a SemVer version (e.g. `1.2.0` for minor features,
    `1.2.1` for patch fixes and `2.0.0` for breaking changes).
-   Version numbers are incremented automatically based on commit
    metadata and commit messages. Git tags map to container tags.

### Security Scanning & Secrets Management

-   A container image scanning step runs after each build to detect
    known vulnerabilities and configuration issues. Only images with
    zero high‑severity issues proceed.
-   Static application security testing (SAST) and software composition
    analysis (SCA) run during CI to identify insecure coding patterns or
    vulnerable third‑party libraries.
-   Secrets (database passwords, API keys) are not stored in code or
    environment files. They are injected at runtime from Azure Key Vault.

### Artifact & Registry Management

-   The image is pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
    ACR enforces immutable images to enable version‑pinning.

### Deployment & Testing in Non‑Production

-   **Development Environment**: On successful build, the image is deployed
    to a development App Service with auto‑provisioned databases and
    message queues. Developers can test against a full stack of
    integrations.
-   **QA Environment**: After merging to `main`, the CI pipeline triggers
    a deployment to the QA App Service. Automated integration and
    regression tests run. The QA environment mirrors production, ensuring
    that performance and scaling issues are detected early.
-   Promotion from dev to QA is automated and requires no manual
    intervention once tests pass. Failures notify the development team
    with logs and metrics.

### Promotion & Approvals

-   A successfully tested build is tagged as a release candidate. A
    promotion pipeline deploys the candidate to the UAT and production
    App Services.
-   Production releases require manual approval from an authorized
    release manager or product owner. The change management process,
    governed by project managers, reviews risk and scheduling.
-   All promotion and deployment activities are recorded in Git and the
    CI/CD system for auditability.

### Progressive Deployment Strategies

Production deployments adopt one of the following strategies:

1.  **Blue‑Green Deployment.** This is the primary strategy, using Azure App Service deployment slots. The new version is deployed to a staging slot. After testing, the staging slot is swapped with the production slot, making the new version live. If issues arise, the swap can be reversed, providing a near-instant rollback.
2.  **Canary Deployment.** While more complex with a monolith, canary releases can be achieved using feature flags to expose new functionality to a small subset of users before a full rollout.

### Observability & Feedback Loops

-   Logs, metrics and traces are collected during each build, test and
    deployment stage. Central dashboards show pipeline health, build
    durations, test coverage, failure patterns and environment‑specific
    behaviour.
-   Alerts notify teams of build failures, test regressions, security
    scan findings or deployment rollbacks, enabling rapid response.
-   DORA metrics—lead time for changes, deployment frequency, change
    failure rate and MTTR—are used to continually improve the pipeline.

Release Management & Scheduling
-------------------------------

Release management ensures that features are delivered predictably and
with minimal disruption. Key practices include:

-   **Release cadences.** Establish regular release windows (e.g. weekly
    or bi‑weekly) and freeze periods before major events. Emergency
    patches follow a separate expedited process.
-   **Change control & governance.** Each release must be approved by a
    change advisory board or product owner according to the project’s
    governance policies. The board reviews risk, compliance, and
    scheduling before deployment.
-   **Release documentation.** Maintain release notes, migration
    scripts, and runbooks. Communicate changes to stakeholders and
    provide user training as needed.
-   **Environment gating.** Releases progress sequentially through Dev,
    QA, UAT and Production. Automated quality gates (test results,
    security scans) and manual approval gates ensure only high‑quality
    releases are promoted.

Rollback Plan
-------------

Despite rigorous testing, issues can still occur. A documented rollback
plan is essential for recovering quickly:

### Application Rollback

-   **Using Deployment Slots:** The primary rollback mechanism is to swap the production and staging slots in Azure App Service, which immediately reverts to the previous version.
-   **Redeployment:** As a fallback, the previous version of the application can be redeployed from the container registry.
-   **Automated rollback triggers:** Configure health probes and alerts
    to auto‑rollback if error rates, latency or CPU usage exceed
    thresholds.

### Database & Schema Rollback

-   **Versioned migrations.** Database changes are applied using
    migration tools (e.g. Flyway or EF Core) with versioned scripts.
    Rollback scripts accompany each change and are tested in QA.
-   **Backward compatibility.** Use additive schema changes (e.g. new
    columns or tables) before removing or altering existing structures.
    This enables rolling forward and backward without breaking older
    versions.
-   **Backups and recovery.** Automated backups run before every
    production deployment. In the event of catastrophic failure, restore
    the database from the last snapshot and redeploy the previous
    version.

### Configuration & Secrets Rollback

-   Configuration changes are stored in version control. Rollback is as simple as re‑applying the
    previous configuration.
-   Secrets are managed via Azure Key Vault; rotating
    secrets does not impact rollback as long as previous secrets remain
    valid until the rollback completes.

### Communication & Incident Handling

-   **Notification:** When a rollback occurs, inform stakeholders via
    the incident communication plan. Provide status updates and
    root‑cause analysis once resolved.
-   **Post‑mortem:** After recovery, document what went wrong, how it
    was detected, and actions taken. Feed learnings back into the
    pipeline by adding tests, monitoring or process improvements.

Security & Compliance Considerations
------------------------------------

-   **RBAC & ownership.** Pipelines enforce fine‑grained role‑based
    access control so only authorized developers can modify pipeline
    definitions or deploy to specific environments.
-   **GitOps & audit trails.** Pipeline definitions and environment
    configurations are stored in Git. Every change is logged and
    traceable for auditability and compliance.
-   **Secrets management.** Sensitive data is never stored in code.
    Integration with Azure Key Vault ensures secrets
    are encrypted and rotated.
-   **Compliance scanning.** Security scans check for license violations
    and compliance issues. Pipeline steps enforce vulnerability fix SLAs
    before promotion to production.

Tools & Implementation Technologies
-----------------------------------

-   **Version control:** Git (GitHub or Azure DevOps Repos) stores code,
    pipeline definitions.
-   **CI/CD orchestration:** Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitHub Actions
    run the CI and CD stages. Pipelines are written in YAML and use
    container‑based agents.
-   **Container registry:** Azure Container Registry stores signed
    images. Each image is immutable and versioned.
-   **Deployment:** Azure App Service hosts the application.
-   **Monitoring & Logging:** Azure Monitor, Application Insights and
    Prometheus/Grafana collect metrics and logs. Alerts integrate with
    Slack or Teams.

Continuous Improvement
----------------------

The pipeline is not static. Teams should continuously review DORA
metrics, build durations and failure rates to identify bottlenecks and
improve efficiency. Feedback from post‑mortems and lessons learned from
rollbacks should inform new tests, improved monitoring and refined
deployment strategies.

Conclusion
----------

Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline with progressive delivery and a
documented release/rollback plan is critical to deliver PineCone Pro’s
ERP/IMS with confidence. By enforcing semantic versioning, scanning for vulnerabilities,
standardising templates, and leveraging blue-green deployments,
the team can deploy frequently
and recover quickly from failures. Combined with strong governance,
role‑based access control and environment separation, this pipeline will
enable the organisation to deliver features rapidly while maintaining
high quality and compliance.
