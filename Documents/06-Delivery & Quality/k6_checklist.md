# k6 Adoption Checklist for PineCone Pro ERP/IMS

## Platform Preparation

- [x] Confirm k6 runtime availability (local binary, Docker image, or k6 Cloud) and document installation steps per environment.
- [x] Ensure target API endpoints are reachable from the chosen runtime (e.g., `host.docker.internal` mapping, VPN, TLS cert trust).
- [x] Align test environment data and configuration wth production-like volumes, including seeded reference data and credentials.
- [ ] Capture non-functional requirements (latency, throughput, error budgets) to drive threshold definitions.
- [ ] Reserve monitoring and logging access (APM, database metrics, container stats) for correlation during runs.

## Script Foundations

- [x] Create `ERP_backend/tests/k6` folder structure with subfolders for `scenarios`, `lib`, `data`, and `reports`.
- [x] Implement a reusable base script pattern (`lib/httpClient.js`, `lib/util.js`) for headers, auth, and helper assertions.
- [ ] Externalize environment-specific values via `__ENV` variables or configuration JSON loaded with `open()`.
- [x] Define smoke baseline (`smoke.js`) that hits `/health` and key CRUD endpoints with lightweight checks.
- [x] Add functional checks with `check()` and tag failures using `group()` so regressions pinpoint quickly.

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] Model steady-state usage with `constant-arrival-rate` to validate SLA compliance under expected load.
- [x] Add peak/ramp profile using `ramping-arrival-rate` to surface scaling bottlenecks before promotions.
- [x] Include endurance/soak test (`duration >= 1h`) to detect memory leaks in ASP.NET services.
- [x] Test background jobs or batch imports with `per-vu-iterations` or `shared-iterations` executors.
- [x] Stress-test failure handling by increasing load beyond capacity and monitoring graceful degradation.

## Data & State Management

- [x] Store synthetic datasets in `data/*.json|csv` and load with `SharedArray` to avoid per-VU duplication.
- [x] Implement token/session acquisition within `setup()` and distribute via `__ENV` or shared state.
- [x] Reset or clean test data post-run via `teardown()` hooks or API helpers to keep environments reusable.
- [x] Version-control large payloads and fixtures, keeping sensitive values in secrets management.

## Metrics & Outputs

- [x] Define `thresholds` for latency percentiles, error rate, and custom metrics (e.g., business KPIs).
- [x] Emit custom `Trend`, `Counter`, or `Rate` metrics for domain events (orders created, invoices synced).
- [x] Export summaries (`--summary-export reports/<timestamp>.json`) for historical analysis.
- [ ] Wire results to a time-series backend (InfluxDB, Prometheus Remote Write, Datadog) for dashboarding.
- [ ] Trigger automated alerts when thresholds fail (CI build fail, Slack webhook, PagerDuty integration).

## CI/CD Integration

- [ ] Add `npm` or `dotnet` script aliases (e.g., `load:smoke`, `load:regression`) to standardize execution commands.
- [ ] Incorporate smoke suite in pull-request pipeline; fail builds on threshold breaches or script lint errors.
- [ ] Schedule nightly load/stress jobs via CI (GitHub Actions cron, Azure DevOps schedule) targeting staging.
- [ ] Archive artifacts (HTML/JSON summaries, Grafana snapshots) alongside build outputs for audits.
- [ ] Document rollback playbook steps that reference latest performance baselines.

## Observability & Analysis

- [ ] Correlate k6 metrics with ASP.NET counters (`dotnet-counters`, Application Insights) and database performance stats.
- [ ] Capture logs/traces during runs (structured logging enabled, request IDs) to trace failures.
- [ ] Produce post-run analysis template summarizing pass/fail, bottlenecks, regression deltas, and action items.
- [ ] Track trend lines across builds to detect slow drifts before they breach SLAs.

## Team Practices

- [ ] Review k6 scripts during code review for maintainability and correctness.
- [ ] Share run results in sprint reviews and include learnings in the test strategy documentation.
- [ ] Train developers/QA on extending scenarios and interpreting k6/Grafana dashboards.
- [ ] Keep dependency versions (k6 binary, extensions) pinned and update quarterly with regression runs.
- [ ] Add TODO backlog items for new modules/endpoints so coverage expands with functionality.

## Extension Opportunities

- [ ] Evaluate xk6 extensions (e.g., `xk6-sql`, `xk6-kafka`) if ancillary services need load testing.
- [ ] Pilot k6 Browser module for critical end-to-end flows requiring full rendering.
- [ ] Investigate k6 Cloud for distributed, high-scale testing beyond local resource limits.
- [ ] Integrate with secrets store (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) when running in CI environments.
- [ ] Align test data strategy with privacy/compliance requirements (masking/anonymization in fixtures).

## Completion Gate

- [ ] Checklist reviewed and approved by QA lead and DevOps owner.
- [ ] Added link to this checklist from `test_strategy.md` and onboarding docs.
- [ ] Baseline smoke and load runs executed, results captured, and initial performance targets validated.
