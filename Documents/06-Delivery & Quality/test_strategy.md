Test Strategy for PineCone Pro ERP/IMS
======================================

Purpose and Scope
-----------------

This document describes the testing strategy for the PineCone Pro
ERP/IMS project. It outlines the quality assurance objectives, test
levels, and non‑functional test activities required to verify that all
modules—Product Information Management (PIM), Inventory & Warehouse,
Orders & RMA, Purchasing & Vendor, Shipping & Hazmat, Tax & Reporting,
and Accounting Sync—meet their functional and non‑functional
requirements. The strategy covers the full testing life‑cycle from unit
testing through integration, functional, end‑to‑end, performance,
security and accessibility testing. It draws on best practices such as
the test pyramid and emphasises automation, early detection of defects
and continuous quality feedback.

Testing aims to detect defects early, ensure regulatory compliance,
build user trust and protect the business from financial or reputational
harm. Automated tests reduce repetitive manual work and provide rapid
feedback. The test pyramid concept advises that most tests should be
low‑level unit tests, with fewer integration tests and a small number of
expensive, high‑level tests.

Test Levels and Types
---------------------

### Unit Tests

Unit tests exercise individual methods, functions or components in
isolation. They are low level, close to the source code, inexpensive to
automate and execute quickly in a continuous integration server.
Developers are responsible for writing unit tests for new features and
bug fixes. Coverage targets should be established (e.g. ≥ 80 %) and
monitored by the CI pipeline. Mocking frameworks (e.g. Moq for C\#,
Jasmine/Jest for Angular) can isolate dependencies.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different modules work
correctly together. These tests are simpler in a modular monolith as they are in-process, but still involve actual databases and message queues. Examples include:

- **PIM and Inventory** – verifying that new products propagate to all
    inventory locations.
- **Orders & RMA and Accounting** – ensuring that order creation
    triggers an accounts receivable entry.
- **Purchasing & Vendor** – validating that purchase orders update
    vendor metrics and inventory counts.

Integration tests are run in a controlled
test environment that mirrors production but uses sanitized data.

### Functional Tests

Functional tests validate business requirements without inspecting
intermediate system states. They ensure that each feature behaves as
expected for typical and edge‑case inputs. Example functional tests
include verifying that hazardous materials orders trigger regulatory
shipping documentation or that tax calculations are correct for
different states. These tests run against an environment with realistic
data and may be automated using frameworks such as Cypress or Selenium
for the web front‑end and REST‑assured for APIs.

### End‑to‑End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests replicate user behaviour across the entire application stack.
They verify user journeys such as browsing the catalogue, adding items
to the cart, completing checkout, receiving an order confirmation, and
initiating an RMA. E2E tests are critical for a monolith to ensure that all components—front‑end,
back‑end, database, and integrations—work together. Due to
their complexity and maintenance cost, only critical user flows should
be covered by automated E2E tests, while lower‑level tests catch most
regressions. Manual exploratory sessions supplement automation to
discover non‑obvious issues.

### Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests verify that the system meets defined requirements and
acceptance criteria. They may be automated or manual and often involve
business stakeholders. Acceptance criteria developed during requirements
gathering (e.g. 98 % inventory accuracy, 95 % orders shipped within
24 h) become the basis for these tests. Performance goals such as
response times and throughput should also be validated here.

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests are lightweight tests that exercise the most important
functions to ensure the system is stable after a build or deployment.
Examples include verifying that the application loads, logging in works,
and the order workflow can be initiated. Smoke tests run immediately
after deployment to any environment to decide whether more expensive
tests should proceed.

### Exploratory Tests

Exploratory testing sessions involve testers using the application
without predefined scripts to uncover unexpected issues. These sessions
should be time‑boxed (e.g. two hours) and focus on specific areas.
Testers attempt invalid inputs, unusual workflows and edge cases to
identify defects that automated scripts may miss. Findings from
exploratory testing feed back into the automated suite.

Non‑Functional Testing
----------------------

### Performance Testing

Performance tests evaluate how the system behaves under various
workloads. They measure reliability, speed, scalability and
responsiveness. Key objectives include:

- **Load testing** – verifying that core workflows (e.g. order
    placement, purchase order creation) meet response time targets under
    expected user loads.
- **Stress testing** – determining breaking points by increasing load
    beyond expected levels and ensuring the system fails gracefully.
- **Soak testing** – running the system under steady load for extended
    periods to detect memory leaks or resource exhaustion.
- **Capacity testing** – measuring how many concurrent users/orders
    the system can handle before performance degrades.

Performance tests should run in an environment that reflects production
(hardware, network, data volumes). Tools such as JMeter, k6 or Locust
can simulate load. Results inform capacity planning and trigger tuning
of queries, indexes and caching. The non‑functional requirements define
baseline response times and throughput for each API.

### Security Testing

Security testing evaluates the system’s resilience against threats and
ensures compliance with regulations. The PractiTest article outlines key
best practices: identify security requirements based on applicable
standards (e.g. PCI DSS, HIPAA) and perform risk assessments; design
security tests that simulate real‑world attacks, including vulnerability
scans and penetration testing; execute tests systematically using
automated tools and involve security experts; analyze results,
prioritise vulnerabilities by severity, and fix them; retest to verify
fixes and report results to stakeholders in clear language. Common
security test types include:

- **Vulnerability scanning** – automated scanning for known weaknesses
    such as outdated dependencies, misconfigurations or weak passwords.
- **Penetration testing** – ethical hackers attempt to exploit
    authentication, authorization or input handling flaws.
- **Risk assessment and threat modelling** – identifying potential
    threats and their impact.
- **Static and dynamic analysis** – scanning code and running
    applications with tools like OWASP ZAP, SonarQube or Snyk.
- **Compliance testing** – ensuring adherence to standards such as
    SOC 2, GDPR or hazardous‑materials shipping regulations.

Security tests should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Automated
scans run on each commit, while periodic penetration tests and audits
occur before major releases.

### Accessibility Testing

Accessibility testing ensures that the web application is usable by
people with disabilities and complies with standards like WCAG 2.1. The
University of Wisconsin–Madison guide recommends the following
practices:

- **Combine automated and manual testing.** Automated tools
    (e.g. WAVE, Google Lighthouse, Axe) can detect technical barriers
    such as missing alt text, low colour contrast, improper heading
    hierarchies and inaccessible forms. Manual testing is required to
    discover functional barriers such as keyboard navigation, logical
    reading order and accessible dynamic content.
- **Perform keyboard navigation tests** by tabbing through all
    interactive elements, ensuring a visible focus indicator, and
    verifying logical navigation order. Check that “skip to main
    content” links work and that menus close with the Esc key.
- **Conduct screen reader tests** using VoiceOver, NVDA or JAWS to
    verify that headings, alt text and navigation order convey meaning
    correctly.
- **Use automated page scanners and site crawlers** to evaluate large
    portions of the site, but review the reports and ensure manual
    review for images, banners, charts or forms.

Accessibility tests are part of both unit (e.g. verifying ARIA
attributes in components) and E2E test suites. Failures block promotion
until resolved.

### Spell Checking

Spell checking is an important part of maintaining the quality of the codebase and documentation. It helps to catch typos and spelling errors in code comments, documentation, and user-facing strings. Automated spell checking can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that all committed code is free of spelling errors. Tools like `cspell` can be used to perform automated spell checking.

### Reliability and Resilience Testing

- **Chaos/Resilience tests** simulate failures of dependencies
    (e.g. database outage, message queue slowdowns) to verify that
    the application degrades gracefully, times out correctly and recovers without
    data loss. Injecting faults in a controlled environment reveals
    weaknesses before they occur in production.
- **Backup and recovery tests** validate that data can be restored
    from backups and that failover procedures meet recovery objectives.

Test Environment and Data
-------------------------

Different environments are used for testing, each requiring appropriate
data:

- **Development:** synthetic data or dummy records to test units and
    small integration slices. Developers can create data in their local
    containers.
- **QA / Staging:** mirrors production infrastructure and uses
    sanitized production data. Test data sets cover typical and edge
    cases across all modules.
- **UAT:** sanitized data with full workflows for acceptance tests.
- **Performance & Security test environments:** dedicated clusters
    configured like production to avoid impacting regular testing. Data
    volumes reflect expected load.

Test data management processes must anonymize personal or sensitive
information and seed data sets deterministically so tests are
repeatable.

Test Data Management Strategy
-----------------------------

- **Data Generation:** Realistic test data will be created using a combination of synthetic data generation tools and sanitized production data. For performance testing, data generation scripts will be used to create large volumes of data that mimic production data distribution.
- **Data Sanitization:** Production data will be anonymized before being used in test environments. This process will involve scrubbing all personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data. A dedicated ETL process will be created to extract, sanitize, and load production data into the QA and Staging environments.
- **Data Refresh:** The test data in the QA and Staging environments will be refreshed on a regular basis (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) to ensure that the test environment remains representative of the production environment. The refresh process will be automated.
- **Data Seeding:** For automated tests, a set of well-known test data will be seeded into the database before the tests are run. This will ensure that the tests are deterministic and repeatable. The seeding process will be part of the CI/CD pipeline.

Test Automation Framework
-------------------------

Automation is vital for fast feedback and reliability. Each test layer
uses appropriate tools:

| Stack                | Scope / Test Type               | Example Tools                                                                 | Notes                                                                                                       |

CI pipelines must run unit and integration tests on each pull request;
functional, E2E and non‑functional tests run nightly or before major
releases. Failing tests break the pipeline and prevent promotion.

Metrics and Reporting
---------------------

Measuring test effectiveness helps improve quality. Key metrics include:

- **Test coverage:** percentage of code exercised by automated tests.
- **Pass/fail rates:** number of tests passing or failing per build.
- **Defect leakage:** defects found in later stages (e.g. production)
    that should have been caught earlier.
- **Mean time to detect (MTTD) & mean time to resolve (MTTR):**
    tracked through DORA metrics.
- **Performance indicators:** response times, throughput, error rates
    from performance tests.
- **Security vulnerability counts:** number and severity of issues
    detected in scans.
- **Accessibility compliance score:** percentage of pages passing
    automated accessibility checks.

Test results and metrics are published to dashboards accessible to the
team and stakeholders. Regular reviews of metrics guide improvement
initiatives.

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

- **Developers** write unit tests, assist with integration tests and
    fix defects.
- **QA engineers** design and maintain integration, functional, E2E,
    performance and accessibility tests; manage test environments;
    perform exploratory testing.
- **Security analysts** conduct penetration tests, review
    vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security requirements.
- **Accessibility specialists** guide compliance with WCAG and assist
    with manual testing.
- **Product owners and business analysts** define acceptance criteria
    and participate in acceptance testing.

Test Schedule and Release Readiness
-----------------------------------

Testing activities are planned for each sprint and release. Unit and
integration tests run continuously. Functional and E2E tests run at
least nightly and before any production release. Performance, security
and accessibility tests run at defined checkpoints (e.g. before major
milestones or once per iteration). A release cannot proceed unless:

1. All critical unit, integration, functional and E2E tests pass.
2. Performance tests meet or exceed non‑functional requirements.
3. Security scans show no high‑severity vulnerabilities and
    medium‑severity issues have remediation plans.
4. Accessibility checks report no critical issues.

Conclusion
----------

By following this comprehensive test strategy, PineCone Pro ensures that
its ERP/IMS is robust, secure, performant, and accessible. Embracing the
test pyramid—with many unit tests, some integration and functional
tests, and a few end‑to‑end tests—provides rapid feedback and
maintainable test suites. Integrating performance, security and
accessibility testing into the development life‑cycle, supported by
automation and clear metrics, helps deliver a high‑quality solution that
meets customer expectations and regulatory obligations.
