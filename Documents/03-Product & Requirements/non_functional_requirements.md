1. Purpose and Scope
--------------------

This document defines the non‑functional requirements (NFRs) for the
Enterprise Resource Planning and Inventory Management System (ERP/IMS)
being implemented at PineCone Pro Supplies (PCS). While the Product
Requirements Document specifies functional capabilities, this NFR
document outlines the quality attributes—performance, availability,
scalability, security and compliance—that the system must meet to
support business objectives. The goal is to ensure that as PCS
transitions from disparate spreadsheets to a unified ERP/IMS, the system
is reliable, resilient and capable of supporting future growth.

- **Primary Feature List:** Describes the key functional capabilities
    required for the ERP/IMS.
- **Product Requirements (MVP & Phase 2):** Provides functional
    requirements and initial non‑functional targets such as concurrent
    user load, latency, and uptime.

3. Performance Requirements
---

### 3.1 Concurrency and Throughput

The system must support up to **200 concurrent users** performing a mix
of activities including order entry, inventory transactions, purchasing,
reporting and administration. Concurrency levels should scale linearly
as new warehouses or sales channels are added. The system should handle
at least **100 new sales orders per minute** without performance
degradation during peak periods, reflecting the multi‑channel order
volumes noted in the business scenario.

### 3.2 Response Time and Latency

- **Order Processing:** The system shall process and commit each sales
    order (from validation through payment authorisation and stock
    reservation) in **≤ 2 seconds** on average. Even during peak loads,
    the 95th percentile response time for order creation must not exceed
    **3 seconds**.
- **Inventory Updates:** Inventory transactions (receipts, transfers,
    picks, cycle counts, returns) must reflect in the system within
    **1 minute** of completion. This ensures accurate
    available‑to‑promise and prevents oversells.
- **User Interactions:** Navigation between screens, saving master
    data records and running standard queries (e.g., product lookups)
    should respond in **≤ 1 second** for 90 % of interactions. Heavy
    analytics dashboards may take up to **3 seconds** but should display
    progressive loading indicators.
- **Reports & Batch Processes:** Batch jobs such as nightly inventory
    reconciliations, tax report generation or data exports must complete
    within **2 hours** to avoid impacting daily operations.
    User‑initiated reports should generate within **30 seconds** or
    provide asynchronous notification upon completion.

### 3.3 Scalability

The system must scale to support growth in SKUs, warehouses and
channels. Currently PCS manages more than **12 000 SKUs** across
multiple locations; architecture must accommodate at least **50 000
SKUs** without major re‑engineering. Horizontal scaling (e.g., adding
application nodes) should allow throughput to increase proportionally.
Database design should partition data by company or warehouse to
distribute load, and cloud resources should scale automatically based on
CPU and memory utilisation. The modular architecture must support
integration of Phase 2 modules (demand forecasting, promotion engine,
light manufacturing) without downtime.

### 3.4 Efficiency & Resource Utilisation

System components must optimise resource usage to minimise
infrastructure costs while ensuring responsiveness. Memory utilisation
should remain below **70 %** on average to allow for overhead and
spikes. CPU utilisation should not exceed **80 %** during normal
operations. Database queries must be indexed and optimised; expensive
reports should be pre‑aggregated or executed off‑peak. Use caching for
read‑heavy endpoints such as product catalog queries and price lookups.
Client‑side applications should minimise network chatter by using batch
APIs and local caching.

4. Availability & Service‑Level Objectives (SLOs)
---

### 4.1 Uptime Targets

PCS operates continuous e‑commerce, requiring high system availability.
The ERP/IMS must achieve **99.9 % uptime** overall, equating to no more
than **8.76 hours** of unplanned downtime per year. Critical functions
(order entry, inventory updates, purchasing, tax calculation) should be
designed for **high availability (HA)** through load balancing,
clustering and automated failover.

### 4.2 Business Continuity

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** In the event of a system outage,
    recovery of core ERP/IMS functionality must occur within **1 hour**
    to ensure service‑level targets (e.g., shipping 95 % of orders
    within 24 hours) are maintained.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The system must restore data
    without more than **5 minutes** of data loss. Transactional data
    (orders, receipts, payments) must be replicated to a secondary site
    in real‑time.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Full backups must be taken nightly
    with point‑in‑time recovery enabled. Hot standby or multi‑region
    database replication should be employed to meet RTO/RPO. Disaster
    recovery plans must be tested twice annually.

### 4.3 Maintenance Windows

Planned maintenance should be scheduled outside peak business hours
(e.g., weekends at 2 a.m. ET) and limited to **≤ 4 hours** per month.
Where possible, updates should be performed in a rolling manner to avoid
downtime. Users must be notified 48 hours in advance of scheduled
maintenance.

### 4.4 Monitoring and Alerts

The system must provide real‑time monitoring of application health,
database performance, message queues and integration points. Key metrics
(CPU, memory, disk I/O, response times, error rates) must be collected
and visualised. Alerts shall be configured for threshold breaches (e.g.,
response time &gt; 2 seconds, database replication lag &gt; 1 minute).
On‑call engineers should receive notifications via email/SMS/Slack.
Root‑cause analysis must be performed for any incidents impacting SLOs,
and corrective actions documented.

5. Security and Compliance Requirements
---

Although the focus of this document is performance and availability,
security and compliance are closely related to system reliability. PCS
handles hazardous products and multi‑state taxes; thus compliance and
data protection are vital.

### 5.1 Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC)

All modules must implement RBAC with fine‑grained permissions for
functions such as product management, purchasing, order processing and
financial reporting. Users should be assigned roles (e.g., warehouse
associate, CSR, purchasing lead, accountant, admin) with least‑privilege
access. Changes to roles and permissions must be logged.

### 5.2 Data Privacy & Protection

Sensitive data (payment information, customer details, vendor terms)
must be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES‑256). Passwords
must be stored using salted hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2). Access to
production data should be restricted, and environment segregation
(dev/test/prod) enforced. Audit trails must track user activity,
including record creation, updates and deletions.

### 5.3 Regulatory Compliance

- **Hazardous Materials:** The system must support OSHA and DOT
    regulations for handling and shipping hazardous chemicals, including
    Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) tracking and hazmat documentation.
    Rules regarding permitted carriers, quantity limits and placarding
    must be enforced.
- **Tax & Audit:** Sales tax must be calculated and filed correctly
    for North Carolina and prepared for additional states (Virginia,
    South Carolina). Audit logs must be retained for at least
    **7 years** to satisfy regulatory requirements.
- **Data Retention:** Customer and transaction data must be retained
    according to legal requirements (minimum **7 years** for financial
    records). Data disposal processes must be implemented.

6. Reliability and Integrity
---

### 6.1 Data Accuracy

Inventory accuracy must be maintained at or above **98 %** as measured
by cycle counts and reconciliations. The system shall implement
validation rules, double‑entry transactions and exception handling to
prevent data corruption. Concurrency controls (optimistic locking,
versioning) must ensure consistent updates when multiple users edit the
same records.

### 6.2 Error Handling and Graceful Degradation

The system must handle external failures (e.g., payment gateway
downtime, carrier API errors) gracefully, providing clear messages to
users and retrying operations where appropriate. In the event of partial
failures, the system should degrade functionality while preserving core
capabilities (e.g., allow order entry even if tax service is temporarily
unavailable, with tax recalculated later).

### 6.3 Testing and Quality Assurance

Non‑functional requirements must be validated through load testing,
failover testing and security penetration tests. Performance tests
should simulate peak loads with realistic data volumes. Continuous
integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines should include
automated regression tests and environment configuration checks.

7. Maintainability and Support
---

### 7.1 Modularity and Configurability

The ERP/IMS should follow a modular architecture with well‑defined
interfaces for each module (PIM, inventory, order management,
purchasing, finance). Business rules (e.g., reorder point thresholds,
tax rates, promotions) must be configurable without code changes. Clear
documentation should describe configuration options and extension
points. Source code should follow industry standards with sufficient
comments to aid maintenance.

### 7.2 Observability and Logging

Comprehensive logging is essential for troubleshooting and auditability.
Logs must capture user actions, API requests/responses and system events
with timestamps. Log levels (info, warn, error) should be configurable.
Logs must be centralised and searchable; sensitive data should be
redacted.

### 7.3 Support and Incident Management

An incident management process should be established with defined
severity levels, escalation paths and communication channels.
Post‑incident reviews must include root‑cause analysis and action items.
Support teams must have access to monitoring dashboards, logs and
runbooks. A knowledge base should provide answers to common issues and
troubleshooting steps.

8. Environmental and Operational Constraints
---

- **Integration Dependencies:** The ERP/IMS integrates with external
    systems such as e‑commerce platforms, Amazon marketplace, POS,
    payment gateways and carriers. Availability of these third‑party
    services may affect overall performance and must be monitored. The
    system should implement retries and fallbacks when external APIs are
    unavailable.
- **Hardware/Infrastructure:** Deployment will be cloud‑based to
    leverage auto‑scaling and HA features. Data centres must meet
    Tier III standards and maintain redundant power, networking and
    cooling. Network bandwidth must be sufficient to support data
    replication and API calls.
- **User Environment:** The system must support modern browsers
    (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and responsive UI design for tablets
    and desktop. RF scanners used in warehouses must integrate
    seamlessly and continue operating offline with local caching,
    synchronising when connectivity is restored.

9. Compliance with Service‑Level Agreements
---

To ensure that the ERP/IMS meets contractual commitments, service‑level
agreements (SLAs) and service‑level objectives (SLOs) must be defined,
monitored and enforced. Key SLAs include:

| Metric | Target | Rationale | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Order shipping SLA | 95 % of orders shipped within 24 h (business days) | Aligns with the functional requirement to fulfil orders quickly | Service‑level target |
| Inventory accuracy | ≥ 98 % | Reduces oversells and stockouts | SLO for reliability |
| System uptime | ≥ 99.9 % | Ensures availability for multi‑channel operations | Non‑functional target |
| Concurrent users | Support ≥ 200 users | Allows growth while maintaining responsiveness | Capacity planning |
| Tax accuracy | 100 % compliance | Avoids fines and supports multi‑state expansion | Compliance requirement |

10. Assumptions and Dependencies
---

This document assumes that:

1. Network connectivity between warehouses, 3PLs and cloud
    infrastructure is reliable and redundant.
2. Third‑party services (payment gateways, tax engines, carrier APIs,
    EDI connections) provide SLAs that are consistent with PCS’s SLOs.
3. Users will receive adequate training and adopt new workflows; change
    management will address resistance.
4. Data migration from legacy systems will be completed before go‑live,
    with data cleansed to meet accuracy requirements.
5. The accounting system and other integrated platforms support
    real‑time or near‑real‑time APIs for synchronisation.

11. Risks and Mitigation
---

- **Integration Failure:** Complex integrations (e‑commerce, Amazon,
    POS, 3PL, accounting) might introduce latency or failure points.
    Mitigation: use robust API middleware, implement retry logic and
    monitor external services.
- **Infrastructure Limitations:** Under‑provisioned infrastructure
    could lead to poor performance. Mitigation: conduct capacity
    planning and load testing; leverage auto‑scaling.
- **Regulatory Changes:** New tax rules or hazmat regulations could
    require system modifications. Mitigation: design flexible tax and
    compliance modules; establish a process to monitor regulatory
    updates.
- **Security Breaches:** Data breaches could impact customer trust and
    result in fines. Mitigation: employ strong encryption, RBAC,
    penetration testing and regular security audits.
- **Data Quality Issues:** Inaccurate data from legacy systems or
    vendors could undermine reliability. Mitigation: implement
    validation rules, data cleansing and vendor scorecards.
