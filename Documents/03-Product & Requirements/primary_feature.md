Based on the scenario, PineCone Pro Supplies needs an ERP/IMS that can
unify data across all departments and replace a patchwork of
spreadsheets and disconnected systems. The key features they require
are:

- **Product Information Management:** Maintain a single source of
    truth for 12,000+ SKUs—including kits/bundles, unit conversions,
    hazardous classifications and pricing—so that all channels (web, B2B
    portal, POS and Amazon) reference consistent product data.

- **Real‑time Inventory & Warehouse Control:** Support multi‑warehouse
    operations (Greensboro DC, Charlotte cross‑dock, Reno 3PL) with
    bin/zone management, RF scanning and cycle counts. The goal is 98 %
    inventory accuracy and reliable available‑to‑promise to eliminate
    oversells and stockouts.

- **Order Management with Payments & Fraud Checks:** Orchestrate
    orders from B2B and B2C channels (web storefront, B2B portal, POS,
    Amazon FBM/FBA), including payments and fraud screening, while
    meeting a sub‑24 h service‑level target for 95 % of orders.

- **Purchasing & Vendor Management:** Provide vendor scorecards,
    handle minimum order quantities and lead‑time data, and automate
    purchase orders using reorder points and economic order quantity
    (EOQ). Advanced shipping notice (ASN) receiving and drop‑ship
    support are needed to replace guesswork in replenishment.

- **Lot/Expiry & Serial Tracking:** Track lot numbers and expiration
    dates for finishing chemicals and serial numbers for high‑value
    tools to support recalls and warranty/service requirements.

- **Shipping & Rate Shopping:** Integrate with carriers to compare
    shipping rates, manage hazmat documentation and support
    cross‑dock/3PL workflows.

- **Returns/RMA Workflow:** Provide a standardized RMA process with
    disposition codes (restock, refurbish or scrap) to reduce friction
    in returns and improve inventory accuracy.

- **Tax Calculation & Reporting:** Automate county‑level sales tax for
    North Carolina and prepare for expansion into Virginia and South
    Carolina; manage hazardous‑materials compliance and generate audit
    trails.

- **Basic Accounting Integration:** Synchronize GL, accounts payable
    and accounts receivable data so that financials, purchasing and
    sales feed the same ledgers.

- **Operational Analytics & Alerts:** Provide dashboards and alerts
    for KPIs such as cycle‑count accuracy, order fulfilment times,
    vendor performance and tax liabilities.

Looking ahead to Phase 2, the business also plans to add demand
forecasting and EOQ optimization, a promo engine and contract pricing,
light manufacturing/kitting with BOM versioning, 3PL bidirectional
integration, a customer service console with SLA timers and EDI links
with large vendors. Features such as full MRP/APS, HR/payroll and field
service are explicitly excluded from the initial scope.
