Integration Contracts & Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
=======================================================

Purpose & Scope
---------------

This document defines the interfaces, responsibilities and service‑level
obligations for integrating the ERP/IMS platform with external systems.
The goal is to ensure seamless data exchange and reliable operations
across the following integrations:

-   **Web Store (E‑Commerce storefront and point‑of‑sale)** –
    synchronization of catalog, orders and payments.
-   **Third‑Party Logistics (3PL) provider** – outbound fulfillment,
    inbound receiving and inventory updates.
-   **Accounting system** – posting journal entries, accounts
    receivable/payable and financial reporting.
-   **Sales Tax service** – real‑time tax calculation and transaction
    reporting.

Each section documents the interface protocols (REST APIs, message
events, EDI), data formats, security requirements and the service‑level
targets that each party must meet. The agreements align with the
non‑functional requirements for performance, availability and security
and draw upon industry benchmarks and external SLAs (e.g., API2Cart
guarantees 99.8 % monthly uptime, TaxJar advertises 99.99 % uptime and
sub‑20 ms response times, and 3PL providers commit to same‑day or
next‑day shipping with &gt;98 % accuracy).

General Requirements
--------------------

1.  **Communication Patterns** – Synchronous requests use RESTful APIs
    with JSON payloads. Event‑driven interactions use Azure Service Bus
    topics/queues, following the message contracts defined in the event
    schema document. All messages include a standard envelope with
    `eventId`, `timestamp` and correlation IDs.

2.  **Authentication and Authorization** – All API calls require OAuth
    2.0 access tokens; event consumers must authenticate using managed
    identities. Role‑based access control ensures callers may only
    perform permitted actions.

3.  **Data Format and Versioning** – JSON is the default format with
    explicit property names. Schema versions use semantic versioning
    (v1, v2) in the URL or message subject. Breaking changes require a
    new version.

4.  **Transport Security** – HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ is mandatory for all HTTP
    endpoints. Messages on the Service Bus use Transport Layer Security.
    Sensitive fields (payment tokens, PII) must be encrypted at rest.

5.  **Monitoring and Alerts** – Each integration exposes metrics
    (uptime, latency, error rates) to Azure Monitor. Alerts trigger when
    thresholds are breached. Monthly scorecards are shared with
    stakeholders.

6.  **Change Management** – Changes to integrations (new endpoints,
    message schema changes) require at least 30 days’ notice and
    parallel support for both old and new versions for 90 days.

7.  **Disaster Recovery** – All external connections must be designed
    for redundancy. The ERP/IMS will retry transient failures using
    exponential backoff. Persistent failures trigger manual intervention
    according to escalation procedures.

Integration 1 – Web Store (E‑Commerce & POS)
--------------------------------------------

### Scope

-   Real‑time product catalogue synchronization (SKUs, bundles, pricing,
    hazardous attributes, images).
-   Order placement from the web store and in‑store POS, including
    support for promotions and contract pricing.
-   Payment authorization, fraud screening, settlement and refunds.
-   Inventory visibility (available‑to‑promise) and reservation on
    checkout.
-   Customer account creation and updates.

### Interfaces and Protocols

| Interaction | Direction | API/Channel | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product Sync (full & delta) | ERP → Web store | REST GET /api/v1/products + change events | Paginated product list with catalogue attributes, units, bundle compositions, hazard codes. | Full export nightly; delta updates pushed via ProductUpdated events. |
| Order Placement | Web store → ERP | REST POST /api/v1/orders | Order header (customer info, shipping & billing address), line items, payment method, gift messages, coupons. | Must be idempotent (duplicate clientOrderId ignored). |
| Payment & Fraud | Web store ↔︎ ERP/Payment Gateway | REST POST /api/v1/payments and POST /api/v1/fraud-check | Payment token, amount, currency, tax, shipping; fraud screening request. | ERP returns authorized/declined status and risk score. |
| Inventory Availability | ERP → Web store | REST GET /api/v1/inventory/{prod uctId} | Available, reserved and on‑order quantities per warehouse/fulfilment node. | Exposed to storefront to prevent overselling. |
| Order Status Updates | ERP → Web store | Service Bus OrderStatusChanged events | Status transitions (pending, processing, shipped, cancelled, return received). | Used to notify customers via email/SMS. |

### Service Level Targets

-   **Uptime** – The API endpoints consumed by the web store must be
    available **≥ 99.9 %** of the time. A 99.9 % uptime allows
    approximately 1 min 26 s of downtime per day. Downtime beyond this
    threshold will result in service credits proportional to the outage
    duration.
-   **Latency** – For 95 % of calls, API response time must be
    **≤ 2 seconds**; 99 % of calls must complete within **5 seconds**.
    Catalog delta events must be published within **15 minutes** of
    changes.
-   **Throughput** – The ERP must handle bursts of at least **10 orders
    per second** and **1 000 catalogue updates per minute** during
    promotions.
-   **Data Accuracy** – Product and pricing data must be **100 %
    accurate**; orders must not be lost or duplicated.
-   **Security** – All requests must be authenticated; failed
    authentications result in HTTP 401. Payment tokens are never
    persisted in plain text.
-   **Support** – P1 incidents (integration unavailable) require
    acknowledgement within **15 minutes** and resolution or workaround
    within **2 hours**.

### Responsibilities & Obligations

| Party | Obligations |
|---|---|
| ERP/IMS | Expose stable, well‑documented APIs; publish product and inventory events promptly; provide sandbox environment; ensure idempotency; maintain comprehensive logging and trace IDs. |
| Web Store | Use provided APIs responsibly; respect rate limits; handle error responses gracefully and retry idempotently; provide accurate customer and payment data; secure API credentials; notify ERP of planned maintenance that might increase call volume. |

    instructions for orders, including hazmat documentation and carrier
    rate shopping.
-   **Inbound receiving:** Notification of incoming purchase orders
    (ASN), receiving details and put‑away confirmations.
-   **Inventory updates:** Real‑time updates to on‑hand quantities,
    damaged/returned goods and cycle count results.
-   **Returns (RMA):** Handling returns authorisations, receiving
    returned items, and recording disposition (restock, refurbish,
    scrap).

### Interfaces and Protocols

| Interaction | Direction | API/Channel | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pick/Ship Instruction | ERP → 3PL | REST POST /api/v1/fulfilment/orders | Order reference, warehouse location, pick list, carrier service preference, hazmat flags. | Generated automatically when orders reach “ready to ship” status. |

| Inbound ASN | ERP → 3PL | REST POST /api/v1/receiving/advance-shipment-notice | PO number, vendor, expected delivery date, cartons/pallets and item quantities. | Enables the 3PL to plan receiving resources. |
| Receiving Confirmation | 3PL → ERP | REST POST /api/v1/receiving/receipts | PO number, received quantities, discrepancies, damages, lot/expiry details. | Must be sent within 48 hours of receipt. |
| Inventory Adjustment | 3PL → ERP | Service Bus InventoryAdjusted events | SKU, lot/serial, adjustment quantity (+/−), reason (cycle count, damage, shrinkage). | Supports real‑time inventory accuracy. |
| Return Receipt | 3PL → ERP | Service Bus ReturnReceived events | RMA number, items returned, condition, disposition (restock/refurbish/scrap). | Updates ERP and triggers refund or replacement. |

### Service Level Targets

-   **Order Fulfilment Speed** – For direct‑to‑consumer orders received
    by **12 PM local warehouse time**, the 3PL must ship **≥ 98 %** of
    orders the same day. Large LTL orders must ship **≥ 95 %** within
    **3 business days**. The ERP will transmit orders by 12 PM or
    earlier.
-   **Inbound Processing** – The 3PL must process **≥ 95 %** of inbound
    shipments and ASN receipts within **2 business days**.
-   **Order Accuracy** – Pick/pack accuracy must be **≥ 99 %**, meaning
    the correct items and quantities are shipped.
-   **Inventory Accuracy** – Cycle counts and inventory adjustments
    should maintain **≥ 98 %** on‑hand accuracy. Discrepancies over 2 %
    require root cause analysis.
-   **Uptime** – Fulfilment APIs and EDI endpoints must be available
    **≥ 99.8 %** of the time, matching typical logistics SLAs.
-   **Latency** – Shipping confirmations and inventory adjustments must
    be sent within **30 minutes** of the physical event; inbound
    receipts within **48 hours**.
-   **Security & Compliance** – The 3PL must comply with
    hazardous‑materials shipping regulations; data must be exchanged via
    TLS and sensitive documents (e.g., hazmat declarations) encrypted at
    rest.
-   **Penalties & Credits** – Failure to meet fulfilment speed or
    accuracy metrics for a calendar month may trigger service credits or
    cost reductions.

### Responsibilities & Obligations

| Party | Obligations |
|---|---|
| ERP/IMS | Provide complete and accurate order and ASN data; perform rate shopping; provide shipping labels and customs/hazmat documents; reconcile inventory adjustments; pay freight invoices timely. |
| 3PL Provider | Pick, pack and ship orders according to SLA; process inbound shipments and returns promptly; provide accurate data; maintain facility security and regulatory compliance; communicate outages or delays. |

Integration 3 – Accounting System

### Service Level Targets

-   **Uptime** – Accounting APIs must be available **≥ 99.9 %**,
    aligning with typical SaaS accounting SLAs (allowing about
    1 min 26 s downtime per day).
-   **Latency** – Journal entry, invoice and bill POST requests must
    return **≤ 2 seconds** for 95 % of calls. Batch posting of up to
    **1 000 entries** must complete within **30 seconds**.
-   **Data Consistency** – Financial data (amounts, taxes, account
    codes) must be **100 % accurate**; any error in posting must be
    corrected via reversing entries. Failed transactions must be
    re‑queued automatically for retry.
-   **Synchronization Window** – Customer/vendor master data sync should
    run at least **every hour**; payment status updates should be
    reflected in ERP within **15 minutes** of being recorded in the
    accounting system.
-   **Security & Compliance** – Integrations must comply with accounting
    standards (GAAP/IFRS). User credentials and OAuth tokens must be
    stored securely. Only authorized users with finance roles may
    execute posting actions.
-   **Support** – P1 finance integration outages require acknowledgement
    within **1 hour** and resolution within **4 hours**; posting errors
    resulting in financial misstatements must be corrected before the
    next business day.

### Responsibilities & Obligations

| Party | Obligations |
|---|---|
| ERP/IMS | Generate accurate financial data and mapping to GL accounts; respect accounting system rate limits; reconcile balances daily; maintain an audit trail of postings; handle duplicate or failed postings gracefully. |
| Accounting System Provider | Provide stable APIs and documentation; support sandbox for testing; maintain 99.9 % uptime; enforce appropriate access controls; notify ERP of planned maintenance or version changes. |

Integration 4 – Sales Tax Service
---------------------------------

### Scope

-   Real‑time tax calculation for quotes and orders based on
    jurisdiction, product tax codes and customer exemptions.
-   Committing completed transactions to the tax service for reporting
    and returns filing.
-   Supporting tax adjustments for returns and refunds.

### Interfaces and Protocols

| Interaction | Direction | API/Channel | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Calculate Tax | ERP → Tax service | REST POST /api/v1/tax/calculate | Ship‑from and ship‑to addresses, order amount, line details with tax codes, customer exemption codes. | Called at checkout and order submission. |
| Commit Transaction | ERP → Tax service | REST POST /api/v1/tax/commit | Unique transaction ID, calculated tax, final amounts, document type (sale, refund), date. | Sent after payment capture or shipment. |
| Adjust/Refund Transaction | ERP → Tax service | REST POST /api/v1/tax/adjust | Original transaction ID, adjustment amount, reason (return, discount). | Ensures updated liability. |
| Tax Rate & Code Sync | Tax service → ERP | REST GET /api/v1/tax/rates / GET /api/v1/tax/codes | Jurisdiction rates, taxability rules. | Updated nightly or as published. |
| Exemption Certificate Validation | ERP → Tax service | REST GET /api/v1/tax/exemption/{certificateId} | Certificate details, status. | Validates before finalizing transaction. |

### Service Level Targets

-   **Uptime** – The tax calculation API must be available **≥ 99.99 %**
    of the time. TaxJar advertises 99.99 % uptime for its sales tax API
    and sub‑20 ms response times; similar providers (Avalara) offer
    near‑“four nines” availability. If uptime falls below 99.5 %, tax
    calls may default to configured backup rates.
-   **Latency** – Average tax calculation response times should be
    **&lt; 50 ms**, with a target of **sub‑20 ms** for 90 % of calls.
    Commit and adjust calls must complete within **2 seconds**.
-   **Accuracy** – Tax calculations must be **≥ 99 % accurate** and
    backed by an accuracy guarantee. Incorrect tax calculations or
    delayed commits may result in penalties from tax authorities; thus,
    the integration must validate addresses and tax codes.
-   **Resilience** – If the tax service is unavailable, the ERP must
    fall back to cached tax rates or manual calculation and flag orders
    for later reconciliation. All uncommitted transactions must be
    retried automatically until successful.
-   **Security & Compliance** – Tax data must include sensitive personal
    information (addresses). All calls must use TLS; addresses and tax
    IDs must be encrypted at rest; logs must not contain full PII.
    Access tokens must be scoped appropriately.

### Responsibilities & Obligations

| Party | Obligations |
|---|---|
| ERP/IMS | Provide complete and accurate data (addresses, line items, tax codes); handle failures and retries; maintain audit trail of tax calculations and commitments; ensure backups for offline calculation; integrate exemption certificates. |
| Tax Service Provider | Offer high availability (≥ 99.99 % uptime) and low latency (sub‑20 ms); provide up‑to‑date tax rates and rules; maintain accuracy guarantee; support real‑time status monitoring; notify ERP of outages. |

Common Reporting & Audit Requirements
-------------------------------------

Across all integrations, the ERP/IMS must record detailed logs of API
calls, event publications and acknowledgements. Logs must include
timestamps, request/response payloads (with sensitive fields masked),
correlation IDs and error codes. These logs support:

-   **Regulatory compliance and audit** – The tax integration demands an
    audit trail for every calculation and commit; financial integrations
    require traceability of journal entries and invoices; 3PL
    integrations need evidence of shipment and receiving events.
-   **Service performance reporting** – Uptime, latency and error rates
    must be reported monthly to stakeholders. For example, DCL Logistics
    tracks order fulfilment speed and accuracy, and TaxJar exposes its
    uptime and response time statistics. Similar dashboards should be
    provided for each integration.
-   **Issue diagnosis and SLA enforcement** – Detailed logs and metrics
    enable root cause analysis when service‑level targets are missed and
    support the calculation of service credits or penalties.

Change Log and Review
---------------------

This Integration Contracts & SLA document will be reviewed and updated
quarterly or whenever significant changes are made to the integrations.
Changes must be communicated to integration partners at least
**30 days** in advance and must include both the updated contract and a
summary of the impacts.
