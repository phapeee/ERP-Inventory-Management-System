Module Specifications – Implementation
======================================

Purpose and scope
-----------------

This document defines the **detailed implementation specifications** for
each core module in the PineCone Pro ERP/IMS solution. These module
specifications translate the high‑level requirements, acceptance
criteria and architecture decisions into implementable features and
workflows. Each module description covers its purpose, functional
capabilities, data entities, process flows, API and integration
considerations, user roles and permissions, error handling, performance
targets and non‑functional considerations. The objective is to provide
development teams and stakeholders with a clear and consistent blueprint
for building and testing the system.

Conventions
-----------

- **CRUD notation:** Create, Read, Update and Delete operations.
- **Status codes:** Use standard HTTP response codes for APIs
    (e.g. 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500
    Internal Server Error).
- **Time stamps:** All records must include `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`
    and, where relevant, `StatusChangedAt` fields. Timestamps use
    ISO 8601 format and the system’s default timezone
    (America/New\_York).
- **Identifiers:** Use UUIDs for primary keys and correlation IDs.
    Reference numbers visible to users (e.g. order number, RMA number)
    can be sequential but must map back to the UUID.

## 1. Product Information Management (PIM)

### 1.1 Overview

The PIM module is the **central hub** for storing and governing all
product‑related data across the organisation. It provides a unified
repository for over 12 000 SKUs, including finished goods, kits/bundles,
variants and hazardous products. PIM supports multi‑channel publishing
(web store, Amazon, POS, B2B portal) and ensures that product data is
consistent, complete and up to date. According to industry guidance, PIM
consolidates product information from different departments and
distributes it to multiple sales channels. It helps manage complex
product data, supports conversion optimisation and automates product
creation processes.

### 1.2 Functional capabilities

1. **Product catalogue management**
    - Maintain hierarchical categories (department → category →
        subcategory) and attributes for each product (e.g. dimensions,
        weight, unit of measure, hazardous classification).
    - Support variants (size, colour, packaging) via parent–child
        relationships.
    - Allow creation of **kits/bundles** that reference component
        products and calculate kit inventory availability from component
        stock levels.
    - Provide **rich descriptions**, images and digital assets for
        marketing channels. Include support for multiple languages.
2. **Data governance and validation**
    - Enforce **required attributes** for each product type (SKU,
        name, description, unit conversions, hazardous handling
        instructions). Required fields ensure completeness and accuracy
        when products are created or updated.
    - Validate units of measure and conversions (e.g. case → each) at
        the time of data entry to prevent inconsistent packaging
        definitions.
    - Maintain approval workflows: new products must be reviewed and
        approved by the Operations Manager and the E‑Commerce Manager
        before publishing to sales channels.
    - Provide audit trails capturing who created, updated or approved
        each record.
3. **Channel syndication**
    - Support scheduled and ad‑hoc **export of product data** to
        external channels (web store, Amazon, B2B portal). Use the
        events and API layer to publish `ProductCreated`,
        `ProductUpdated` and `ProductDeleted` events to downstream
        systems.
    - Allow mapping of internal attribute names to channel‑specific
        fields. Channel connectors transform and transmit data using
        each platform’s API.
    - Provide status tracking of each export job (success, error) and
        error remediation capabilities.
4. **Hazardous product management**
    - Identify products with hazardous classifications (DOT/IATA
        classes) and flag them accordingly.
    - Store required regulatory data such as **UN/NA numbers**, hazard
        classes, packaging instructions and hazard statements.
    - Prevent publication to channels that do not support hazmat items
        (e.g. certain carriers or Amazon categories).

### 1.3 Data entities

- **Product** – primary entity containing master attributes (ID, SKU,
    name, description, category, manufacturer, brand, status,
    dimensions, weight, hazardous flag, productType). Contains
    `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` fields for versioning.
- **ProductAttribute** – key–value table for extensible attributes
    (e.g. colour, size, material). Supports multi‑language translations.
- **KitComponent** – mapping table linking kit parents to component
    products and their quantities.
- **ChannelMapping** – stores mapping definitions between internal
    product fields and external channel fields.
- **ProductRevision** – captures historical versions of product
    records for auditing and rollback.

### 1.4 Process flows

1. **Create/Update product**
    1. User (Purchasing Lead or Product Administrator) enters product
        details via UI or API.
    2. System validates required fields and unit conversions. If
        validations fail, returns 400 with error details.
    3. Upon submission, record status is set to *Draft*. Audit fields
        `CreatedBy` and `CreatedAt` are captured.
    4. Operations Manager and E‑Commerce Manager receive a
        **ProductApprovalTask**. They review and approve; once both
        approve, status changes to *Active*.
    5. System publishes a `ProductCreated` or `ProductUpdated` event to
        the in-process event bus.
    6. Channel connectors detect the event and push product data to
        external systems.
2. **Publish to channel**
    1. Scheduled job or user triggers an export.
    2. System gathers active products, transforms fields via
        ChannelMapping and calls external channel APIs.
    3. On success, sets `LastExportedAt` timestamp; on failure, logs
        error and notifies administrators.

### 1.5 API and integration

- **Inter-module Communication:** The PIM module communicates with other modules exclusively through the in-process event bus. It publishes events such as `ProductCreated`, `ProductUpdated`, and `ProductPriceChanged` and subscribes to events from other modules to trigger its workflows. This ensures maximum decoupling.
- **External Integrations:** The module integrates with external systems like the Web Store, Amazon, and B2B portals via dedicated connectors that consume its public API or react to its published events.

### 1.6 Roles and permissions

- **Purchasing Lead / Product Administrator:** Create/update products
    and kits but cannot approve.
- **Operations Manager:** Approve products and manage hazardous
    classifications.
- **E‑Commerce Manager:** Approve products for channel publication and
    manage digital assets.
- **Warehouse Associate:** Read-only access for reference on packaging
    and handling.
- **Auditor:** Read-only access to product history and audit logs.

### 1.7 Error handling

- **Validation errors** (missing mandatory fields, invalid unit
    conversions) return 400 with detailed error messages.
- **Duplicate SKU** returns 409 Conflict.
- **Channel export failure** logs error with correlation ID and sends
    a notification. Retries are attempted according to exponential
    backoff.

### 1.8 Performance and scalability

- The system must support **thousands of concurrent product updates**
    with minimal latency. Publishing to channels should handle batch
    sizes of up to 10 000 products.
- Use asynchronous processing for exports via background workers and
    message queue to avoid blocking UI transactions.
- Indexes on SKU, status and channel mapping fields ensure fast
    queries.

### 1.9 Non‑functional considerations

- **Security:** Enforce role-based access control. Sensitive fields
    (e.g. cost price) should be masked except for authorised roles.
- **Regulatory compliance:** Follow hazardous materials regulations;
    restrict editing of hazmat data to authorised personnel. Keep
    historical records for regulatory audits.
- **Audit:** Every change to product data must be logged with user,
    timestamp and before/after values.

## 2. Inventory & Warehouse Management

### 2.1 Overview

This module governs the storage, tracking and control of physical
inventory across all warehouses, cross‑docks and 3PL facilities. It must
maintain **real‑time stock levels** and ensure that physical counts
match system records. The system supports bin/zone management,
RF‑enabled picking and cycle counts to achieve ≥ 98 % inventory
accuracy. Cycle counting is a method of periodic inventory auditing that
verifies physical counts against recorded balances without halting
operations. Proper cycle counting improves data integrity and uses
scheduled counts for high‑value items. Inventory management also
monitors reorder points, manages lot/expiry and serial numbers, and
integrates with purchasing and order fulfilment workflows.

### 2.2 Functional capabilities

1. **Multi‑warehouse & location management**
    - Define physical warehouses, distribution centers and
        cross‑docks. Each facility has zones, aisles and bins. Include
        location attributes (temperature control, hazardous storage).
    - Support **3PL integration** for remote warehouses; maintain
        separate location codes but unify inventory view across internal
        and 3PL sites.
    - Transfer stock between locations with appropriate paperwork and
        inventory adjustments.
2. **Inventory transactions**
    - Track all stock movements: receipts, put‑aways, picks,
        transfers, adjustments, cycle counts, returns and disposals.
    - Each transaction records `TransactionType`, `Quantity`,
        `LotNumber` (if applicable), `SerialNumber` (if applicable),
        `FromLocation`, `ToLocation`, `CreatedBy` and timestamps.
3. **Cycle counting and accuracy**
    - Configure **ABC cycle counting**: high‑value or fast‑moving
        items counted more frequently. Generate cycle count tasks
        automatically.
    - Provide RF scanning support for counting. After counts, variance
        is calculated and an adjustment transaction is created if
        needed.
    - Report **inventory accuracy** as the ratio of correct counts to
        total counts.
4. **Lot, expiry and serial management**
    - Capture lot numbers and expiration dates at receiving. Require
        this information for regulated products as per primary
        requirements.
    - Assign serial numbers to high‑value tools; link serial numbers
        to warranty or service records.
    - Implement **first‑expiry‑first‑out** (FEFO) picking for items
        with expiry dates.
5. **Reorder point and safety stock**
    - Calculate reorder points based on historical demand, lead times
        and safety stock policies. When on‑hand falls below the reorder
        point, generate purchase recommendations.
    - Provide dashboards showing days‑of‑supply, safety stock levels
        and pending POs.
6. **Inventory valuation**
    - Maintain cost layers (FIFO, LIFO or weighted average). Costing
        method is configurable per product.
    - Update cost of goods sold (COGS) when inventory is issued to
        orders or scrapped.

### 2.3 Data entities

- **Warehouse** – defines physical facility; includes address,
    timezone, capacity and flags for 3PL.
- **Location** – child of warehouse; includes zone, aisle, bin code,
    type (picking, bulk, returns, hazmat), capacity.
- **InventoryItem** – snapshot of quantity on hand by Product,
    Location, Lot, Serial (optional) and status (available, allocated,
    quarantined). Contains reorder point and safety stock fields.
- **InventoryTransaction** – logs every inventory movement; references
    product, lot/serial, quantity, source/destination, user, date and
    reason.
- **CycleCountTask** and **CycleCountResult** – tasks for scheduled
    counts and recorded results.

### 2.4 Process flows

1. **Receiving and put‑away**
    1. Create or import **ASN** (advanced shipping notice) from vendor
        or 3PL.
    2. Warehouse associate scans incoming cartons, captures lot/serial
        information and verifies against expected quantities.
    3. System creates a `Receipt` transaction and updates
        `InventoryItem` records.
    4. Generate put‑away tasks to move stock from inbound staging to
        storage bins.
2. **Picking and shipping**
    1. When an order is allocated, a **pick list** is generated. Items
        are selected using FEFO or FIFO rules.
    2. Warehouse associate picks items using RF scanners; system
        validates picks by scanning barcodes.
    3. Upon completion, system records `Pick` transactions and updates
        `InventoryItem` balances; picks are associated with `Shipment`
        records in the orders module.
    4. If lot or serial numbers are required, they are captured during
        picking.
3. **Cycle counting**
    1. Scheduler generates daily/weekly cycle count tasks by item
        class.
    2. Associate counts items in designated bins and enters counts via
        RF device.
    3. System compares counted quantity to system quantity; variances
        create `Adjustment` transactions and update inventory accuracy
        metrics.

### 2.5 API and integration

- **Internal API:** The Inventory module exposes an internal API for other modules to consume. This API is not exposed publicly. Inter-module communication is done via in-process calls.
- **Public API:** The Inventory module exposes a public API for external clients. The endpoints are defined in the API Specifications document.
- **External integrations:** 3PL systems exchange stock data via
    asynchronous events (e.g. `InventoryUpdated`,
    `CycleCountCompleted`); purchasing module triggers reorders when
    reorder points are breached.

### 2.6 Roles and permissions

- **Warehouse Associate:** Create inventory transactions (receipts,
    picks, transfers) and cycle count results.
- **Operations Manager:** Manage location definitions, approve
    adjustments and review inventory accuracy reports.
- **Purchasing Lead:** View inventory levels to plan procurement.
- **Auditor:** Read-only access to inventory transactions.

### 2.7 Error handling

- **Over‑pick/under‑pick**: If pick quantity exceeds available stock,
    system raises error; under‑picks prompt re-allocation or backorder.
- **Mismatch during receiving**: If received quantity differs from
    ASN, system flags discrepancy and requires supervisor approval.
- **Negative inventory prevention**: Transactions cannot cause
    negative on‑hand; system rejects transaction and logs event.

### 2.8 Performance and scalability

- **Real‑time updates:** Inventory changes must propagate within
    &lt; 1 minute to ensure accurate availability across all modules.
- **High volume transactions:** System should handle thousands of RF
    scans per hour. Use batch processing for cycle count tasks.
- **Indexing:** Index `InventoryItem` on `ProductId`, `WarehouseId`,
    `LocationId` and `LotNumber` for fast lookups.

### 2.9 Non‑functional considerations

- **Reliability:** Use event sourcing or journalling to reconstruct
    inventory state from transactions in case of failures.
- **Security:** Limit write access to inventory transactions. Serial
    numbers and lot details must be traceable for recalls.
- **Compliance:** Track hazardous storage locations; ensure proper
    segregation of hazmat goods and maintain necessary documentation.

## 3. Orders & Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA)

### 3.1 Overview

The Orders & RMA module manages the entire lifecycle of customer orders
(B2B and B2C), from entry through fulfilment, invoicing and returns. It
must centralize orders from multiple channels (web store, Amazon, POS,
B2B portal) and ensure that fulfilment meets the organisation’s
service‑level targets. The module also handles the reverse logistics
process—returns management—to streamline authorisation, inspection,
disposition and refund processing. Efficient returns management improves
customer satisfaction and reduces costs, while ensuring that returned
items are reintegrated into inventory where possible.

### 3.2 Functional capabilities

1. **Order capture and validation**
    - Accept orders via API or UI, capturing customer details,
        shipping addresses, items, quantities, and chosen shipping
        methods.
    - Validate inventory availability through the Inventory module;
        allocate stock immediately or place items on backorder if
        insufficient.
    - Calculate taxes and shipping costs using Tax & Shipping modules.
    - Perform **fraud screening** using integrated payment processor
        services.
2. **Order workflows**
    - **New → Allocated → Picked → Shipped → Invoiced → Closed**.
        Orders can also be **Cancelled** or **Returned**.
    - Support partial shipments and partial invoices.
    - Provide actions for Customer Service Representatives (CSR) to
        edit orders before shipment (e.g. change quantities, shipping
        address) within defined time limits.
    - Automatically generate **shipment records** with tracking
        numbers and integrate with the Shipping module.
3. **Payment processing**
    - Integrate with payment gateways to authorise and capture
        payments. Securely store tokens; do not retain full card data.
    - Handle pre‑authorisations at order placement and capture upon
        shipping. Support refunds and partial refunds.
4. **Returns and RMA management**
    - Implement an **RMA issuance workflow**: customer requests
        return, CSR validates reason and issues RMA number with
        expiration date.
    - Track return status: *Authorised*, *Received*, *Inspected*,
        *Completed*.
    - Record inspection results and determine disposition (restock,
        refurbish, scrap) as per requirements.
    - Generate refund or store credit depending on disposition; update
        financial records and inventory.
    - Provide reverse logistics labels via Shipping module; track
        return shipments and update status accordingly.

### 3.3 Data entities

- **Order** – header with customer info, status, total amounts,
    payment status, timestamps.
- **OrderLine** – product, quantity ordered, quantity allocated, unit
    price, tax and discount details.
- **Payment** – stores payment authorisations, captures and refunds;
    includes gateway transaction IDs, status and amount.
- **Shipment** – records pick and pack details, carrier, service
    level, tracking numbers and dates.
- **RMA** – header with customer, order reference, reason, status,
    issue date and expiration date.
- **RmaLine** – returned items, quantity, condition, disposition and
    refund amount.

### 3.4 Process flows

1. **Order placement**
    1. Order is submitted via web store or API. System performs data
        validation and calculates totals.
    2. Inventory module reserves stock; if not available, sets
        backorder flag.
    3. Payment is pre‑authorised. Order status becomes *Allocated* and
        events `OrderPlaced` and `OrderAllocated` are published.
2. **Picking and shipping**
    1. Warehouse module creates pick lists; after items are picked,
        shipments are created and shipping labels generated.
    2. Order status moves to *Picked*; after shipping, tracking numbers
        are recorded and status changes to *Shipped*. `OrderShipped`
        event is published.
    3. Payment is captured; invoice is issued.
3. **Returns process**
    1. Customer requests a return through the portal or CSR. CSR issues
        an RMA number and instructs the customer to send items back.
    2. When returned goods arrive, they are inspected. Inspection
        results determine disposition: restock, refurbish or scrap.
    3. Inventory and financial adjustments are made; refund or credit
        is processed.
    4. `RmaCompleted` event is published.

### 3.5 API and integration

- **Internal API:** The Order module exposes an internal API for other modules to consume. This API is not exposed publicly. Inter-module communication is done via in-process calls.
- **Public API:** The Order module exposes a public API for external clients. The endpoints are defined in the API Specifications document.
- **External integrations:** Payment gateways (e.g. Stripe,
    Authorize.Net), shipping carriers via the Shipping module, tax
    calculation via Tax module, financial posting via Accounting Sync.

### 3.6 Roles and permissions

- **Customer Service Representative (CSR):** Create orders, edit
    orders until shipped, issue RMAs, process returns.
- **Warehouse Associate:** Pick, pack and ship orders; cannot cancel
    or modify orders.
- **Operations Manager:** Override allocations and approve
    cancellations and refunds.
- **Accountant:** View financial impacts and issue refunds.

### 3.7 Error handling

- **Payment failure:** If payment pre‑authorisation fails, order is
    not created; return error and ask user to retry.
- **Allocation failure:** If inventory cannot be reserved, system
    places items on backorder and notifies Purchasing.
- **Invalid RMA:** If return is attempted without a valid RMA or after
    RMA expiration, system rejects return.

### 3.8 Performance and scalability

- **Concurrent orders:** Support at least 200 concurrent users and
    order placements, meeting the SLA defined in non‑functional
    requirements.
- **Order volume:** System must handle spikes (e.g. seasonal sales) of
    thousands of orders per hour; order processing tasks should run
    asynchronously where possible.

### 3.9 Non‑functional considerations

- **Security:** All payment interactions must comply with PCI DSS.
    Sensitive data (cards, personal info) should be tokenised.
- **Audit:** Record all status changes and user actions; include
    `OrderHistory` and `RmaHistory` tables.
- **Customer experience:** Provide order tracking and status
    notifications to customers via email/SMS.

## 4. Purchasing & Vendor Management

### 4.1 Overview

This module automates the procurement process—from requisition through
purchase order issuance, vendor communication and receipt of goods. A
robust purchasing system helps reduce manual data entry, track spending
and maintain supplier relationships. According to procurement software
guidance, purchase order systems automate requisition approval and PO
creation, support users in submitting requests and comparing supplier
quotes, and provide flexible approval routing based on purchase amount
or category. This module also maintains vendor scorecards, handles
minimum order quantities and lead times and integrates with inventory
and accounts payable.

### 4.2 Functional capabilities

1. **Requisition and approval workflow**
    - Internal users create requisitions for products or services,
        specifying product, quantity, required date and justification.
    - The system routes requisitions for approval based on purchasing
        policies (amount thresholds, department budgets). Approvers
        receive tasks and can approve, reject or request changes.
    - Once approved, requisitions convert automatically into purchase
        orders.
2. **Request for quote (RFQ) and supplier negotiation**
    - Buyers can send RFQs to one or more suppliers for items lacking
        contracted pricing.
    - Suppliers respond with price, lead time and terms. Buyers
        compare responses and select the best option.
    - System logs responses and selected supplier; declines other
        quotes.
3. **Purchase order management**
    - Generate POs from requisitions or manually. POs include line
        items, unit costs, quantities, expected delivery dates and
        shipping terms.
    - Support drop‑ship orders directly to customers.
    - Provide PO status tracking (Sent, Acknowledged, In Transit,
        Partially Received, Closed).
    - Include approval workflows for POs exceeding thresholds or
        requiring additional sign‑off.
4. **Vendor management and scorecards**
    - Maintain **Vendor** records (contact info, payment terms, lead
        times, ratings).
    - Track vendor performance through on‑time delivery, quality, fill
        rate and cost metrics; compute scorecards.
    - Support vendor onboarding with required documentation (W‑9,
        hazmat handling agreements).
5. **Receiving and matching**
    - Integrate with Inventory module to match received quantities
        with PO lines. Support partial receipts and backorders.
    - Provide three‑way matching for accounts payable: PO, receiving
        and vendor invoice.
6. **Spend analysis and forecasting**
    - Analyse purchasing spend by category, supplier and time period.
        Provide dashboards and alerts for spend overages.
    - Support forecasting of demand and reorder points to plan
        procurement activities.

### 4.3 Data entities

- **Requisition** – header containing requester, department, reason,
    status. Lines contain requested product/service, quantity, required
    date and notes.
- **PurchaseOrder** – header with supplier, shipping terms, payment
    terms, status, total amounts; lines with product, unit cost,
    quantity, delivery date and cost centre.
- **RFQ** – request for quotes sent to suppliers; includes items,
    required quantities and due date.
- **RFQResponse** – responses from suppliers; includes quoted price,
    lead time, currency and validity date.
- **Vendor** – record of supplier with address, contact, payment
    terms, MOQs and lead times; includes performance metrics fields.

### 4.4 Process flows

1. **Requisition to PO**
    1. User submits requisition; system validates budget and ensures
        requested items exist in product master.
    2. Approval workflow routes to department manager and purchasing
        lead; after approval, a PO is generated.
    3. PO is sent to vendor via EDI or email; vendor acknowledges
        receipt.
2. **RFQ and selection**
    1. For new items or when price changes, buyer creates an RFQ;
        system sends to selected vendors.
    2. Vendors submit responses; buyer compares and selects supplier.
    3. Selected quote is converted to PO; non‑selected quotes are
        archived.
3. **Receiving and invoicing**
    1. Upon shipment arrival, warehouse records receipt. Received
        quantity and quality are matched to PO lines.
    2. Accounts payable matches vendor invoice to PO and receipt; any
        discrepancy triggers exception workflow.

### 4.5 API and integration

- **Internal API:** The Purchasing module exposes an internal API for other modules to consume. This API is not exposed publicly. Inter-module communication is done via in-process calls.
- **Public API:** The Purchasing module exposes a public API for external clients. The endpoints are defined in the API Specifications document.
- **External integrations:** EDI with large vendors for PO
    transmission and acknowledgement; email or vendor portals for small
    suppliers; accounts payable systems for invoice matching; 3PL for
    drop‑ship orders.

### 4.6 Roles and permissions

- **Requester:** Create requisitions; cannot submit PO.
- **Department Manager:** Approve requisitions and RFQs.
- **Purchasing Lead:** Manage vendors, issue POs, send RFQs and
    evaluate responses.
- **Operations Manager:** Approve POs above threshold; override
    supplier selection.
- **Accountant:** Perform three‑way match and approve vendor invoices.

### 4.7 Error handling

- **Budget exceed:** If requested amount exceeds department budget,
    system rejects requisition and notifies requester.
- **Over‑received goods:** If received quantity exceeds PO quantity,
    system flags a discrepancy and requires approval.
- **Vendor non‑response:** If RFQs receive no response by due date,
    system escalates to Purchasing Lead.

### 4.8 Performance and scalability

- Must handle hundreds of active POs and requisitions simultaneously.
    Use async workflows for RFQ and PO communications.
- Provide near‑real‑time updates of vendor performance metrics to
    support decision making.

### 4.9 Non‑functional considerations

- **Compliance:** Enforce segregation of duties (requesters cannot
    approve their own requisitions). Retain audit logs of approvals and
    changes.
- **Vendor agreements:** For hazardous materials, require valid hazmat
    agreements and automatically verify before issuing POs.
- **Security:** Limit vendor payment data access to authorised roles;
    encrypt sensitive information.

## 5. Shipping & Hazmat

### 5.1 Overview

This module manages the integration with shipping carriers and ensures
that outbound and return shipments comply with hazardous materials
(hazmat) regulations. It provides functionality for rate shopping, label
generation, tracking, address validation and compliance documentation.
According to the shipping integration overview by Cleveroad, a shipping
API acts as a bridge between carriers, online stores and other systems,
automating tasks such as **rate calculation, label generation and
tracking updates**. Shipping APIs allow businesses to compare shipping
rates across carriers, reduce costs, provide real‑time tracking,
validate addresses and even generate airway bills and labels. They also
automate order creation, show estimated delivery dates and send tracking
updates to customers. For hazardous materials, carriers and shippers
must comply with federal regulations (DOT and IATA) and use
carrier‑approved shipping solutions.

### 5.2 Functional capabilities

1. **Carrier rate shopping**
    - Integrate with multiple carriers (UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL, local
        carriers). Use a multi‑carrier API to request real‑time rates
        based on package dimensions, weight, origin, destination and
        service levels.
    - Compare rates and transit times; apply business rules (preferred
        carrier, lowest cost, fastest service) to select the best option
        for each shipment.
    - Provide shipping cost estimates during checkout.
2. **Label generation and documentation**
    - Automatically generate shipping labels (PDF, ZPL) containing
        sender, recipient, weight, dimensions and tracking information.
        This aligns with shipping APIs that automatically create orders
        and AWB IDs and generate labels.
    - Support printing of **hazardous materials documentation**
        (shippers’ declaration, material safety data sheets) and
        compliance labels for regulated products. Only authorised
        personnel can print hazmat documents.
    - Store label and documentation files for reference in the
        `Shipment` entity.
3. **Real‑time tracking and notifications**
    - Subscribe to carrier webhooks or poll for status updates; update
        shipment status in real time and publish `ShipmentUpdated`
        events.
    - Provide tracking links for customers and send email/SMS
        notifications when shipments are created, in transit, or
        delivered.
    - Include support for non‑delivery reporting (NDR) and manage
        re‑delivery or return to sender.
4. **Address validation and EDD (Estimated Delivery Date)**
    - Validate destination addresses to avoid misdeliveries and reduce
        customer complaints.
    - Calculate and display estimated delivery dates based on
        historical carrier performance and destination data.
5. **Hazardous materials compliance**
    - Flag shipments containing hazmat products. Before generating
        labels, verify that carriers support the hazardous
        classification.
    - Generate proper hazmat documentation (e.g. UN number, hazard
        class, packaging group) and include required markings and labels
        on packages.
    - Use carrier‑approved shipping software, as required by UPS and
        other carriers, and ensure shipments comply with **federal
        Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR)** and **IATA Dangerous
        Goods Regulations**.
    - Maintain signed hazmat agreements for each carrier and verify
        expiration dates.
6. **Returns and RMA shipping**
    - Generate prepaid return labels; track return shipments and
        update return status in the Orders module.
    - Manage pickup scheduling for 3PL returns when necessary.

### 5.3 Data entities

- **Carrier** – defines shipping providers; includes services, API
    credentials, hazmat capabilities and transit time profiles.
- **Shipment** – links to Order, contains carrier, service level,
    package details (weight, dimensions), hazmat flag, tracking number,
    label file and status.
- **ShipmentRate** – temporary entity capturing rate quotes from
    carriers.
- **HazmatDocument** – file record storing hazardous goods
    declarations and supporting data (UN number, hazard class, packaging
    group).

### 5.4 Process flows

1. **Rate shopping and label purchase**
    1. When order is ready for shipping, system requests rate quotes
        from carriers via multi‑carrier API.
    2. System applies business rules to select carrier and service;
        user may override.
    3. System purchases label from chosen carrier; receives tracking
        number and label file.
    4. Shipment record is created with tracking information; label is
        sent to printer.
    5. `ShipmentCreated` event is published.
2. **Hazmat shipment**
    1. If any line on the order is flagged as hazardous, system
        verifies hazmat agreement and obtains required packaging
        instructions and documentation.
    2. Hazmat documents are generated and printed along with the
        shipping label.
    3. Shipments are booked only with carriers that handle the specific
        hazard class.
3. **Tracking and notifications**
    1. Carrier sends status updates; system updates shipment status and
        notifies customers.
    2. If NDR occurs, system alerts CSR to take corrective action.

### 5.5 API and integration

- **Internal API:** The Shipping module exposes an internal API for other modules to consume. This API is not exposed publicly. Inter-module communication is done via in-process calls.
- **Public API:** The Shipping module exposes a public API for external clients. The endpoints are defined in the API Specifications document.
- **External integrations:** Multi‑carrier shipping API providers
    (e.g. ShipEngine, EasyPost), carriers’ proprietary APIs, hazmat
    regulation services, event bus for publishing `ShipmentCreated`,
    `ShipmentUpdated`, `ShipmentDelivered` events.

### 5.6 Roles and permissions

- **Warehouse Associate:** Request rates, print labels and schedule
    pickups.
- **Operations Manager:** Configure carrier accounts, set business
    rules for rate selection, approve hazmat shipments.
- **CSR:** View tracking status and respond to customer enquiries.
- **Auditor:** Access shipment history and hazmat documentation.

### 5.7 Error handling

- **Carrier API failure:** If rate or label purchase fails, system
    retries; after multiple failures, escalates to Operations Manager
    and allows manual processing.
- **Address validation error:** Return 422 Unprocessable Entity with
    validation errors; user must correct address.
- **Hazmat non‑compliance:** If hazmat agreement is missing or product
    class is unsupported, system blocks shipment and logs error.

### 5.8 Performance and scalability

- **Concurrent shipments:** Support hundreds of shipments per hour;
    use asynchronous requests for rate shopping to avoid blocking user
    sessions.
- **Real‑time tracking:** Poll or subscribe to carrier updates with
    minimal latency to ensure timely notifications.

### 5.9 Non‑functional considerations

- **Compliance:** Maintain up‑to‑date hazmat training and
    documentation; implement controls to ensure packaging and labelling
    compliance.
- **Security:** API credentials for carriers must be encrypted. Access
    to hazmat information is restricted.
- **Audit:** Log all label purchases, rate selections and hazmat
    document generations.

## 6. Tax & Reporting

### 6.1 Overview

This module calculates sales taxes for each order based on jurisdiction
(county, state, country) and generates tax reporting data. It also
provides financial and operational reporting across modules. External
tax APIs, such as those provided by TaxJar, deliver reliable tax
calculations; TaxJar reports an average response time below 20 ms and
99.99 % uptime. Accurate tax calculation ensures compliance across North
Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina and future jurisdictions. The
reporting component builds dashboards and analytical reports from
transactional data, supporting decision‑making and audit needs.

### 6.2 Functional capabilities

1. **Sales tax calculation**
    - Determine tax rates based on ship‑to address, ship‑from address
        and product taxability. Use a third‑party tax API (e.g. TaxJar)
        to calculate county and state taxes with high accuracy.
    - Support exemptions (resale certificates, tax‑exempt customers)
        and record exemption certificates.
    - Cache frequently used tax rates to minimise API calls and
        latency.
2. **Tax filing and reporting**
    - Generate monthly, quarterly and annual tax reports by
        jurisdiction, summarising taxable sales, non‑taxable sales,
        collected tax and returns.
    - Provide **audit trails** showing how taxes were calculated for
        each transaction (input addresses, tax codes, rates and API
        responses).
    - Export data in formats compatible with state filing systems.
3. **Financial and operational reporting**
    - Create dashboards and standard reports (sales by product, margin
        analysis, inventory turns, vendor performance, order fulfilment
        times). Use the data model and event stream to produce
        aggregated metrics.
    - Provide ad‑hoc reporting capabilities with filters and
        drill‑down; restrict data visibility by role.
    - Integrate with Business Intelligence tools via data warehouse or
        API.

### 6.3 Data entities

- **TaxTransaction** – captures tax details for each sale: transaction
    ID, jurisdiction codes, taxable amount, tax amount, exemption code,
    API response ID and timestamp.
- **TaxRateCache** – stores tax rates by zip code, state and county
    with effective dates.
- **ReportDefinition** – metadata for saved reports (name,
    description, SQL/dataset, schedule).
- **ReportExecution** – stores each report run with parameters, user,
    execution time and output location.

### 6.4 Process flows

1. **Tax calculation during order placement**
    1. Order module calls Tax API with ship‑to/ship‑from addresses and
        line items.
    2. Tax module receives response; records TaxTransaction and returns
        tax amount to Orders module.
    3. If API call fails, system uses cached rates and logs fallback.
2. **Filing preparation**
    1. Scheduler triggers report generation at end of tax period.
    2. System aggregates TaxTransaction data by jurisdiction and
        generates filings.
    3. Report is reviewed by accountant and submitted to tax authority.

### 6.5 API and integration

- **Internal API:** The Tax & Reporting module exposes an internal API for other modules to consume. This API is not exposed publicly. Inter-module communication is done via in-process calls.
- **Public API:** The Tax & Reporting module exposes a public API for external clients. The endpoints are defined in the API Specifications document.
- **External integrations:** Tax calculation API (TaxJar or similar)
    for real‑time tax rates; Business Intelligence tools for advanced
    analytics.

### 6.6 Roles and permissions

- **Accountant:** Manage tax settings, run tax filings and access
    financial reports.
- **Operations Manager:** View operational dashboards but not raw tax
    details.
- **Auditor:** Access tax audit trails and generate compliance
    reports.

### 6.7 Error handling

- **API failure:** If tax API returns error, system uses cached rates
    and marks transaction for review.
- **Invalid address:** Return error requiring user to provide valid
    address; cannot compute tax without correct jurisdiction.
- **Reporting failure:** If report generation fails due to data error,
    system logs and notifies report owner.

### 6.8 Performance and scalability

- **Low latency:** Tax calculations should return within 100 ms on
    average; rely on caching and high‑performance API providers.
- **High concurrency:** Support concurrent tax calculations for
    hundreds of orders during peak periods.
- **Reporting:** Off‑load heavy reports to asynchronous processes;
    provide status updates and allow retrieval when complete.

### 6.9 Non‑functional considerations

- **Compliance:** Keep transaction data and audit trails for
    regulatory retention periods. Follow Sarbanes‑Oxley (SOX) and
    relevant tax authority guidelines.
- **Security:** Restrict access to tax data; encrypt API keys and
    sensitive fields.
- **Audit:** Provide reproducible calculation details for each
    transaction; include event logs and API response data.

## 7. Accounting Sync

### 7.1 Overview

The Accounting Sync module integrates ERP operational data with external
accounting systems (e.g. QuickBooks, NetSuite, general ledger). It
ensures that all financial transactions resulting from purchases, sales,
inventory movements and returns are correctly posted to the general
ledger and sub‑ledgers. An ERP accounting system integrates financial
management across HR, supply chain logistics, manufacturing, sales and
CRM, providing real‑time data visibility. Modern accounting software
modules include general ledger, accounts payable, accounts receivable,
payroll, expense tracking, bank reconciliation and financial reporting.
The Accounting Sync module aims to synchronise these functions with the
ERP’s operational data.

### 7.2 Functional capabilities

1. **General ledger posting**
    - Map operational transactions to accounting journals. For
        example, when goods are received, debit inventory and credit
        accounts payable; when orders are shipped and invoiced, debit
        cost of goods sold and credit inventory.
    - Support different accounting methods (accrual vs. cash) and
        multi‑currency transactions.
    - Provide **GL mappings** configuration to assign ledger accounts
        by product category, location or transaction type.
2. **Accounts payable (AP) integration**
    - Synchronise vendor invoices from purchasing module to AP ledger.
        Include PO reference, receipt data, due date, discounts and
        approval status.
    - Support partial receipts and partial invoice matching.
    - Publish payment approvals and payment status updates back to
        ERP.
3. **Accounts receivable (AR) integration**
    - Synchronise customer invoices and credit memos. Include tax and
        shipping charges, payment terms and due dates.
    - Update customer balances and record payment receipts via the
        payment gateway.
4. **Bank reconciliation and cash management**
    - Import bank transactions; match them with recorded payments and
        receipts.
    - Create journal entries for bank fees and interest; reconcile
        cash accounts.
5. **Payroll and expense integration**
    - Optionally, import payroll journal entries from HR/payroll
        systems and allocate labour expenses to cost centres.
    - Import corporate card expenses and employee reimbursements into
        the GL and expense tracking.
6. **Data synchronization and reconciliation**
    - Provide two‑way synchronisation: push ERP transactions to
        accounting software and retrieve ledger balances for
        reconciliation. Handle data mapping differences (e.g. chart of
        accounts, customers vs. vendors definitions).
    - Implement batch and incremental sync; allow manual sync
        triggers.
    - Provide dashboards showing sync status (success, pending,
        failed) and reconciliation discrepancies.

### 7.3 Data entities

- **JournalEntry** – header with batch number, date, description and
    status; lines with account, debit/credit amounts, currency and
    reference ID.
- **LedgerAccountMapping** – links ERP transaction types to accounting
    ledger accounts.
- **SyncJob** – logs each sync run with source system, target system,
    start/end times, status and error details.
- **SyncError** – records individual failed records with reason and
    resolution flag.

### 7.4 Process flows

1. **Transaction posting**
    1. When an operational transaction occurs (e.g. PO receipt, order
        shipment), the ERP triggers creation of corresponding journal
        entries via mapping rules.
    2. Journal entries are stored in ERP and queued for
        synchronisation.
    3. Sync job processes queued entries, transforms them to the
        accounting system’s schema and calls the accounting API. If
        successful, marks the journal as posted.
    4. Accounting system returns a response with posted entry ID or
        error; errors are logged and require review.
2. **Reconciliation**
    1. At regular intervals, the sync job requests account balances
        from the accounting system.
    2. System compares ERP sub‑ledger totals with accounting system
        balances; any discrepancies generate reconciliation tasks.
    3. Users investigate and correct mapping or transaction errors.

### 7.5 API and integration

- **Internal API:** The Accounting Sync module exposes an internal API for other modules to consume. This API is not exposed publicly. Inter-module communication is done via in-process calls.
- **Public API:** The Accounting Sync module exposes a public API for external clients. The endpoints are defined in the API Specifications document.
- **External integrations:** QuickBooks Online, NetSuite or other GL
    systems via their APIs (OAuth2 authentication). Support for message
    queues or middleware to decouple ERP from accounting system.

### 7.6 Roles and permissions

- **Accountant:** Configure ledger mappings, review and approve
    journal entries, initiate sync, resolve sync errors.
- **Operations Manager:** View sync dashboards and reconciliation
    reports; cannot modify entries.

### 7.7 Error handling

- **Mapping error:** If no mapping is defined for a transaction type,
    system logs error and notifies accountant; transaction remains
    unposted until mapping is added.
- **Sync failure:** If external API is unavailable or returns error,
    system retries with backoff; after repeated failures, marks sync as
    failed.
- **Reconciliation discrepancy:** System flags mismatch; user must
    resolve before closing period.

### 7.8 Performance and scalability

- Sync jobs must process all transactions within 30 minutes of the end
    of day. Use incremental sync to avoid processing the entire dataset
    daily.
- Support thousands of journal lines per day; batching and pagination
    are required for API calls.

### 7.9 Non‑functional considerations

- **Data integrity:** Ensure that no transactions are lost or
    duplicated. Use idempotent operations and unique reference IDs.
- **Security:** Secure connection to accounting systems via TLS; store
    API credentials securely. Restrict access to sync configuration.
- **Compliance:** Follow GAAP/IFRS standards and audit requirements;
    provide comprehensive audit trail of posted entries.

## 8. Cross‑cutting considerations

1. **Event‑driven architecture:** Each module publishes and consumes
    domain events via an in-process event bus. Events include
    `ProductCreated`, `InventoryUpdated`, `OrderPlaced`,
    `ShipmentCreated`, `TaxCalculated`, `JournalPosted` and
    `RmaCompleted`. Messages follow the standardized schemas defined in
    the Event Schema document. Modules subscribe only to events relevant
    to their bounded context.

2. **Authentication and authorization:** All APIs require JWT tokens
    issued by the identity provider. Role‑based access controls are
    enforced at both the module and data layer (see RBAC matrix).
    Sensitive operations (e.g. refund, hazmat shipping, journal posting)
    require additional multi‑factor approval.

3. **Error logging and monitoring:** Centralized logging captures
    errors and performance metrics. Alerts trigger when error rates
    exceed defined thresholds or service level objectives are breached.

4. **Testing and validation:** Implement unit tests, integration tests
    and end‑to‑end tests for each module. Use synthetic transactions in
    staging to validate workflows. Performance testing should confirm
    that SLAs (e.g. order processing ≤ 2 seconds) are met.

5. **Documentation:** Keep API specifications, event schemas, data
    models and ADRs up to date. Provide user guides for different roles.
    Document all regulatory compliance procedures (hazmat handling, tax
    filing) for audit readiness.
